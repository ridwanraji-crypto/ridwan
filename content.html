    <h4>HOW TO PREPARED A JOLLOF RICE MEAL</h4>
        <p><strong>Prepare the Rice: <br></strong>
            Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. <br>
            Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain. <br>
            <strong>Make the Sauce: <br></strong>
            Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. <br>
            Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent. <br>
            Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute. <br>
            Add the blended red bell pepper and tomato puree. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces and oil begins to separate. <br>
            <strong>Add Seasoning: <br></strong>
            Stir in thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes. <br>
            <strong>Combine Rice and Broth: <br></strong>
            Add the soaked rice to the pot, stirring to coat the rice in the sauce. <br>
            Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring the liquid covers the rice. You may need to adjust the amount of broth based on your rice absorption rate. <br>
            <strong>Cook the Rice: <br></strong>
            Bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat and cover the pot. <br>
            Cook for about 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Avoid lifting the lid too often. <br>
            <strong>Add Vegetables and Protein: <br></strong>
            If using, add mixed vegetables and cooked protein during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. <br>
            Fluff the rice with a fork once done, and adjust seasoning if necessary. <br>
            <strong>Serve:  <br></strong>
            Serve the Jollof rice hot, garnished with additional chopped bell peppers or onions if desired. <br></p>
